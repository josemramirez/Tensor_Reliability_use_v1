Here I make this proof of concept public. Synthetic+Modelling. It will improve in time.

In your environment you need to install this:

pip install --upgrade https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne/archive/master.zip

pip install --upgrade numpy==1.20.3

pip install surpyval

and I made some modifications to the DeepSurv library, but the original should work fine in principle.
